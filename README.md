# DEV is my default folder where i test my stuff. fCC stands for Free Code Camp, one of my certifications, where i got to take my skills to the next level.
# I also keep exploring lots of diferent stuff so this will get messy ! But hang on, maybe some day ill get it ! Some files arent even one project.
# Some of them have lots of code that i did when i was studying with the help of the internet, like youtube tutorials. Thanks internet !
# I hope you guys like some of my progress !
